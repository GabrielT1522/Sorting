Sorting

Created by Gabriel Torres on 10/26/22.

This program implements several different sorting algorithms; (0) Merge Sort, (1) Quick Sort,
and (2) Bubble Sort. The implementations are tested using a set of numbers
in a text file named “numbers.txt”. Each line of the file contains a number. The first number
will be which sorting algorithm to use (1=Merge Sort, 2=Quick Sort, 3=Radix Sort). The second
number will be the number of remaining elements in the file, n. The first two numbers of the file
(sorting algorithm and n) will NOT be sorted. However, the remaining n numbers will be sorted.
The sorted set of numbers are printed onto the screen.
